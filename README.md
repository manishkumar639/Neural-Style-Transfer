# Neural-Style-Transfer
A PyTorch/TensorFlow/Keras implementation of "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" (Leon Gatys et al.) ‚Äî blending the content of one image with the style of another to produce artistic visuals.

üñºÔ∏è Overview
Neural Style Transfer (NST) utilizes a deep convolutional neural network‚Äîoften VGG-19‚Äîto separate image content and style, and combine them into a new image. Starting from a content image p and a style image a, optimization creates an output image x by minimizing a content loss and a style loss, typically with L-BFGS or Adam optimizers. Variants may include total variation loss for smoothing, faster feedforward models (e.g., using perceptual loss), color preservation, masked or multi-style transfer
